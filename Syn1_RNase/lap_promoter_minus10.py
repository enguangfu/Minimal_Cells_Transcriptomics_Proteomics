Promoter -10 signatures at the two Fig. 2 example operons (lap/0154 and 0178).

PART 1 -- lap/0154 (Fig. 2 panel c): which 5' end is the real TSS?
PART 2 -- 0178/neopullulanase (Fig. 2 panel b): does its shared 5' end have a -10 box?

BACKGROUND
----------
Figure 2 panel c uses the leucyl-aminopeptidase operon OP_00078 (lap/MMSYN1_0154,
+ strand) as the example of 5'-biased RNA processing: many isoforms share a 3'
terminator and erode from the 5' end. Two candidate 5' ends compete for the label
"transcription start site":

  A. the OPERON START called by the segmentation (operons.candidate_blocks.tsv,
     `tss` column) -- the most upstream 5' end supported by full-length reads;
  B. the DEPTH-JUMP coordinate -- an internal position where PacBio coverage rises
     several-fold and where a large block of isoform 5' ends piles up.

A depth jump alone is ambiguous: it can mark a genuine internal promoter, or it can
mark the 5' boundary of a processed/degraded population (an endonucleolytic cut, or
5'->3' exonucleolytic stalling) sitting inside a transcript that actually starts
further upstream. The promoter -10 box discriminates between the two: a genuine
sigma-factor TSS carries a recognizable -10 hexamer ~10 bp upstream; a processing
boundary has no reason to.

ALGORITHM
---------
1. COORDINATES (both derived from data, nothing hard-coded):
   A = OP_00078 `tss` from the canonical 459-operon map.
   B = the largest positive step in the PacBio + strand depth bedGraph inside the
       operon span, cross-checked against the read-weighted isoform 5'-end
       histogram (the modal 5' end excluding A).
2. -10 SCAN: promoter_motif.scan_minus10() -- the SAME scanner used for the 127
   canonical operons in Syn1_Operon/Operon_Annotation.py (imported, not copied):
   6-mer TANAAT over [-12,-7] and 9-mer TNNTANAAT over [-15,-7], register shift
   +/-2 bp, best offset = fewest IUPAC mismatches. Tier strong_9mer > core_6mer >
   no_minus10.
3. CONTEXT: the -45..+10 upstream sequence of each candidate is printed with the
   matched box marked, so the call can be checked by eye.
4. NULL MODEL: because the Syn1 genome is AT-rich, TANAAT arises by chance. Two
   baselines are reported -- (i) N random + strand positions scanned identically,
   (ii) the 127 canonical operon TSSs (Operon_Annotation output) -- so "matches
   TANAAT" can be read against how often that happens by accident.
5. LOCAL SPECIFICITY: every position in a window around lap is scanned, to show
   how many positions in the neighbourhood would also pass.

REJECTED LINE OF ARGUMENT (recorded so it is not re-tried)
----------------------------------------------------------
B sits 21 nt upstream of the lap start codon, i.e. near the upstream edge of a
canonical 30S initiation-complex footprint, which invites the story "5'->3' trimming
stalled at a bound ribosome". Tested transcriptome-wide (all 20,885 isoforms with
>=10 reads, dominant 5' end per gene relative to its start codon) this does NOT
discriminate: 24.8% of the 509 testable genes have their dominant 5' end at -25..-15
but a statistically indistinguishable 22.2% have it at -15..-5, inside the footprint.
There is a broad concentration of 5' ends just upstream of start codons, with no
sharp peak at the -20 footprint edge, and short 5'UTRs from genuine promoters land in
exactly the same window. Position relative to the RBS therefore cannot separate
"processed end" from "TSS with a short 5'UTR" -- only the -10 box does.

PART 2 -- 0178 (OP_00099, - strand), the 3'-erosion example
-----------------------------------------------------------
Unlike lap there is no competing coordinate: 2,901 of 3,121 operon-contained reads
(93%) share ONE 5' base and coverage collapses 2861x -> 4x across it, so the only
question is whether that sharp end is a promoter. The same scanner is applied, then
the surrounding 66 bp is swept for the nearest perfect box and the read coverage at
that alternative position is checked.

OUTCOME (see the .txt)
----------------------
PART 1 (lap):
A = 197657 (operon start, 102 reads / 4 clusters): core_6mer -- a PERFECT TANAAT
    hexamer (TAAAAT, 0 mismatches) at register 0, i.e. canonical -10 spacing. The
    9-mer extension misses by 1 (GTGTAAAAT), so the tier is core_6mer, which is the
    tier of 87/127 canonical Syn1 operons.
B = 197721 (depth jump 169x -> 1143x, 6.8-fold; 1003 reads / 26 clusters, the modal
    5' end): no_minus10 -- best 6-mer TATTAT and best 9-mer TGTTATTAT both miss by 1
    at every register within +/-2 bp.
Background: the same scanner matches a 6-mer at 2.4% of random positions and at
68.5% of the 127 canonical operon TSSs (29x enrichment), and the 10 positive
positions among the 185 spanning A..B collapse to 2 box loci, one sitting exactly on
A -- B is in neither.
Conclusion: transcription initiates at 197657, and the 6.8-fold step at 197721 is a
post-transcriptional boundary inside that primary transcript, not a second promoter.

PART 2 (0178) -- no consensus match, but NOT evidence against a promoter:
The dominant 5' end (234511, 93% of reads, 44 nt 5'UTR) does not match the consensus:
best 6-mer TAATAT misses by 1 and best 9-mer AATTAATAT by 2, at every register within
+/-2 bp. This is a scanner non-assignment, not a demonstrated absence of a promoter --
a single deviation from TANAAT is ordinary in real bacterial -10 elements, and 40/127
(31%) of the canonical Syn1 operons are unassigned by the same scanner for the same
reason. The nearest perfect hexamer (TACAAT, genomic 234538-234543) would serve a TSS
~21 nt further upstream, but coverage there is 4x against 2861x at 234511, so it is
not the promoter for the observed transcripts.
Read as: 0178's 5' end is sharp, dominant and intergenic; the -10 scan simply adds
nothing either way. The affirmative -10 argument is available for lap (Part 1) and is
not claimed here.

MINUS-STRAND CONVENTION NOTE
----------------------------
Operon_Annotation.py's tss_pos() returns end0 for minus-strand operons, but end0 is
the half-open exclusive bound, so the true 5' base is end0-1 (a 1 bp offset). Checked
here explicitly: both conventions return the same k-mer and the same tier for 0178
(the +/-2 register search absorbs the offset), so the published classification is
unaffected -- but the 1 bp should not be propagated into any coordinate that is
reported as a TSS.
